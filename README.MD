# Retrieving data from Google Scholar for research 

(Currently in development)

This is repository is my attempt to make a tool that allows users to scrape data from profiles on GoogleScholar. This data will be put into a dataset that contains the following information: 

h-index	- the h-index for the professor for all years

h5-index	- the h-index for the professor for the last five years

i10-index	- the i10 index for the professor for all years

i10-5-index	- the i10 index for the professor for the last five years

n_citations	- the total number of citations

n5_citations	- the total number of citations for the last five years

institution	- the institution of the profile user

name	- name of the profile user

url	- link to the profile 

field - using tags, we determine the field the profile is active in 

Users should be able to fill in their field of interest and the number of profiles they want to scrape. A first version of the scraper has already been used by students of Leiden and Oxford University.
